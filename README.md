The group is working on a Race Light project
About 
RaceLight is an application for people who like to race. The application is designed to help a user reduce their response time as they step on the Accelerator. The application has been created by a team of ISIT students. 
The application helps an individual maintain an activity log. The log can be used for a comparative study and improvement. The timer is attached to the acceleration and it starts and records the time accordingly. 
The scope of this application, RaceLight, is to provide the user with the ability to have a countdown timer which is represented by a Red, Yellow, and Green light, and when the light hits green it says “GO!” and the timer starts. The timer stops when the mobile device feels acceleration and documents the time it took between “GO” and the felt acceleration. It will then send that time up to a Firebase database so that the users will be able to compare launch times between different Racers. Thus, with these documented times, the Racer can improve their off the line times and track their progress overtime. 
Example 
An aspiring driver gets into his personal racecar. They launch the RaceDriver Light app and then select “Start”. The app then starts the countdown to revving engine noises and countdown sounds, “3,2,1,GO!” The driver then accelerates as fast as they can in order to get a good launch time. The app sends the time to Firebase’s database and the driver is then able to review the time as well as other drivers’ times on the Rankings page.
